I've always had a passion about how AI works, and how it is used to solve problems and find solutions. Even though I created an AI repository in the past, but I feel the need to create this new one. This AI project basically solves a transportation problem, where we have a lot of boxes to transport in a single vehicle, but that vehicle has a maximum weight of objects that it can take. So, here we are trying to find a collection of objects that have a weight below the capacity of the vehicle (max-weight) but also has a value that is greater than the quota that we want. The quota is the minimum value of objects that we want to transport at a single moment in time.
